# My Portfolio

This is my _first project_ as part of my carrier sojourn towards the front end development. This portfolio site simply showcases a webpage where you'll get a chance to sneak-peak on different front-end projects that I worked on. 

### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### Familiar with Git?
Checkout this repo using GIT enabled terminal by cloning it as follows:

```
> git clone https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/my-portfolio.git

```

#### Not Familiar with Git?
Click [here](https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/) then download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open the index.html file to view my portfolio site. All dependencies needed for web page display would also get downloaded along with the .zip file.
